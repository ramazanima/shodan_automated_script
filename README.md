# shodan_automated_script

I programmed this Shodan script using Shodan API to automate retrieving specific information. 

For my CodePath cybesecurity course, I had to use Shodan to scan for webcams, routers, open ports with vulnerability, and this script enables easy scanning for specific types of devices or services, gathering information about a specific target (e.g. IP address, software versions, vulnerabilities), analyzing the results of a Shodan search to identify patterns or trends, automating repetitive tasks, such as checking the status of a large number of devices.
